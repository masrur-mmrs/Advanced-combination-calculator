# Advanced-combination-calculator
This is a just a calculator I made to get done with my math hw on binomial expansion :p
Take the equation (x+y)^(n)
It equates to nCr*x^(n-2)*y^r
This claculator outputs nCr, when given n and r.
whats different about this is it works with fractions and negetive numbrs unlike a normal nCr calculator, so you can even calculate nCr for equations like (1+2x)^(-1/2)
